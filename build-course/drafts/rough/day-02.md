# Day 2: The $6,000 Decision Every Contractor Faces (And Most Get Wrong)

**Subject:** Day 2: Why 70% of contractors regret their business structure choice

---

Yesterday you set your transformation goals. Today we're tackling the single biggest mistake that's costing contractors thousands every year - and it's not what you think.

## The Roofer Who Almost Lost Everything

Mike Rodriguez built a solid roofing business in Phoenix. Six years in, steady $185K revenue, good reputation. Then one of his guys fell from a roof.

Workers comp covered the medical bills, but the family's attorney wanted more. They sued for $300,000, claiming inadequate safety equipment.

Here's the kicker: Mike was a sole proprietor.

That meant everything he owned - his house, savings, trucks - was fair game. His $45,000 in savings and $180,000 home equity were on the line because of a business structure decision he'd made years earlier without understanding what it meant.

The lawsuit dragged on for months. Mike kept working to pay legal bills while watching his personal assets hang in the balance. Finally settled for $75,000, but the stress nearly broke him.

"I had no idea being a sole proprietor meant risking everything I'd worked for," Mike told me. "I thought business insurance was enough."

It wasn't.

## The $6,000 Question Every Contractor Must Answer

Here's what most contractors don't realize: **The business structure you choose can save or cost you $6,000+ every single year.**

Not just in taxes (though that's huge). In insurance premiums, loan rates, lost opportunities, and peace of mind knowing your family's home isn't at risk every time you step on a jobsite.

Yet 70% of contractors start as sole proprietors and 55% regret it within three years.

Why? Because nobody explained the real difference between your three main options:

## Option 1: Sole Proprietorship (The "Default" Choice)

**What it is:** You ARE the business. No separation between you and your work.

**The Good:**
- Setup cost: $0
- Paperwork: Minimal
- Taxes: Simple (just add Schedule C to your personal return)

**The Bad:**
- Your personal assets (house, savings, truck) are at risk for ANY business debt or lawsuit
- You pay 15.3% self-employment tax on EVERY dollar of profit
- Banks treat you like a higher risk (higher interest rates, harder to get credit)
- Many commercial clients won't work with sole proprietors

**Real Numbers:** 
- $85,000 profit = $13,005 in self-employment tax alone
- Your home equity at risk from any business lawsuit
- 2-4% higher interest rates on business loans

**Best For:** Part-time contractors earning under $25,000/year who plan to incorporate soon

## Option 2: Limited Liability Company (LLC) (The "Smart" Choice)

**What it is:** A separate business entity that protects your personal assets while keeping taxes simple.

**The Good:**
- Personal assets protected from business lawsuits
- Professional credibility (most GCs require this)
- Better banking relationships and loan terms
- Tax flexibility (can elect different tax treatments later)
- Can bring in partners or sell the business

**The Costs:**
- Formation: $50-$500 (depending on your state)
- Annual fees: $0-$800 (most states under $200)
- Slightly more bookkeeping

**Real Numbers:**
- Same $85,000 profit = same $13,005 self-employment tax BUT...
- Insurance savings: $800-$2,200 annually
- Better loan rates save $300-$600 annually
- Access to projects sole proprietors can't bid

**Best For:** 90% of established contractors earning $25,000+ annually

## Option 3: S-Corporation Election (The "Advanced" Choice)

**What it is:** An LLC that elects special tax treatment to slash self-employment taxes.

**The Game-Changer:**
You pay yourself a "reasonable salary" (subject to payroll taxes), then take additional profits as "distributions" with NO self-employment tax.

**Real Numbers Example:**
- $85,000 profit
- Pay yourself $45,000 salary (market rate)
- Take $40,000 as distributions (no self-employment tax)
- Tax savings: $6,120 annually

**Additional Costs:**
- Payroll processing: $1,800/year
- Extra tax prep: $800/year
- Net savings: $3,520/year

**Best For:** Contractors earning $75,000+ profit annually

## The Electrical Contractor Who Cracked The Code

Sarah Kim owns an electrical company in Austin. Started as sole proprietor, converted to LLC after three years, then elected S-Corp status when her profits hit $95,000.

Her transformation:
- **Year 1-3 (Sole Proprietor):** Paid $14,535 in self-employment tax on $95K profit
- **Year 4 (LLC):** Same taxes, but personal assets protected
- **Year 5 (S-Corp Election):** Paid herself $55K salary, took $40K distribution
- **Tax Savings:** $6,120 annually (after accounting for extra costs)

"The S-Corp election was a no-brainer once I understood the numbers," Sarah says. "As my business has grown to $420K revenue, the savings have gotten even better. I wish I'd done this years earlier."

Three years later, she's saved over $18,000 in taxes and sleeps better knowing her personal assets are protected.

## The Real Cost of Getting This Wrong

Let's talk about what the wrong choice actually costs you:

**Sticking with sole proprietorship when you should convert:**
- $3,000-$8,500 lost annually in tax savings
- $800-$2,200 lost annually in insurance savings
- Higher interest rates costing $500-$1,500 annually
- Lost commercial opportunities (many require LLC/Corp structure)

**Bottom line:** Wrong entity choice costs the average contractor $5,000-$15,000 annually.

Over 10 years? We're talking $50,000-$150,000 you'll never get back.

## Your Action Plan for This Week

**Step 1: Assess Your Current Situation**

Answer these questions honestly:
- Are you currently a sole proprietor earning more than $50,000 annually?
- Do you have employees or regular subcontractors?
- Have you ever had an insurance claim or been threatened with a lawsuit?
- Do banks require personal guarantees on all your business borrowing?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, you need to act now.

**Step 2: Choose Your Structure**

Use this simple decision tree:

- **Annual profit under $50K:** LLC when you're ready to grow
- **Annual profit $50K-$75K:** LLC immediately  
- **Annual profit $75K+:** LLC with S-Corp election

**Step 3: Get the Ball Rolling**

Don't overthink this. Here's your immediate next step:

- **Kentucky contractors:** LLC costs just $40 to file, $0 annual fee
- **Texas contractors:** $300 to file, $0 annual fee, no income tax
- **California contractors:** Consider Nevada or Wyoming LLC ($75-$100 filing)

You can file online in most states and have your LLC approved within a week.

**Step 4: Set Up The Basics**

Once approved:
- Get your EIN (tax ID number) from IRS website (FREE - don't pay services)
- Open business bank account
- Update your insurance policies
- Start using the LLC name on all new contracts

## Why This Matters More Than Ever

The construction industry is changing fast. Insurance costs rising. Regulations tightening. Competition increasing.

Contractors with proper business structures are getting the best opportunities, best rates, best treatment from suppliers and clients.

Those still operating as sole proprietors are getting left behind.

Don't be one of them.

P.S. Mike Rodriguez, that roofer from Phoenix? He converted to LLC immediately after the lawsuit settled. Cost him $960. Within six months, he'd saved that much in insurance premiums alone. Year three, he elected S-Corp status and now saves $4,200 annually in taxes. "Best $960 I ever spent," he says.
