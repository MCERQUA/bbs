**Quick read:** This email takes 3 minutes. It could save you $3,500+ annually and protect everything you own. Worth the read.

## The Lawsuit That Changes Everything

Mike Rodriguez built a solid roofing business in Phoenix. Six years in, $185K revenue, good reputation. Then one of his guys fell from a roof.

Workers comp covered medical, but the family sued for $300,000. Mike was a sole proprietor - which meant his $45,000 savings and $180,000 home equity were suddenly at risk.

After months of legal hell and $75,000 to settle, Mike learned the hard truth: **Your business structure choice can cost you everything.**

## The Real Numbers: What This Actually Costs You

**Most contractors start as sole proprietors.** It's the default choice - no paperwork, no fees.

**It's also the most expensive mistake you can make.**

Here's what switching to the right business structure actually saves contractors:

**LLC Benefits (immediate):**
- Personal assets protected from business lawsuits
- Insurance savings: $800-$2,200/year  
- Better loan rates: Save $300-$600/year
- Access to commercial jobs that require proper licensing

**S-Corp Tax Election (for contractors earning $75K+ profit):**
- **NET tax savings: $3,520/year** (on $85K profit)
- Here's the math: Save $6,120 in taxes, minus $1,800 payroll costs, minus $800 extra tax prep
- **Still puts $3,520 back in your pocket every year**

## The Simple Truth About Business Structures

**Sole Proprietor = You ARE the business**
- Your house, truck, savings all at risk from any business lawsuit
- Pay extra 15.3% tax on every dollar of profit
- Banks see you as high-risk (higher rates, harder credit)

**LLC = You OWN the business** 
- Personal stuff protected from business problems
- Same taxes as sole proprietor, but way more credibility
- Most commercial clients require this anyway

**S-Corp Election = You WORK FOR the business**
- Pay yourself a normal salary (with regular payroll taxes)
- Take extra profits as "owner distributions" (no extra 15.3% tax)
- **Only worth it if you're making $75K+ profit annually**

## How Sarah Saved $18,000 in Three Years

Sarah Kim owns an electrical company in Austin. Started sole proprietor, switched to LLC, then elected S-Corp when profits hit $95K.

**Her numbers:**
- **Years 1-3:** Paid $14,535/year in extra taxes as sole proprietor
- **Year 4:** Same taxes, but house protected with LLC
- **Year 5:** S-Corp election saved $6,120 (minus $2,600 in extra costs = $3,520 net)

Three years later: $18,000+ saved, sleeps better knowing her assets are protected.

## Your Next Steps (Don't Overthink This)

**Step 1: Where Are You Now?**
- Making more than $50K profit annually? You need an LLC minimum
- Making more than $75K profit annually? S-Corp election is worth it
- Been threatened with a lawsuit or insurance claim? LLC protects your personal stuff

**Step 2: File Your LLC (Costs by State)**
Most states let you file online in 10 minutes:

- **Texas:** $300 filing, $0 annual fee → File at sos.state.tx.us
- **Florida:** $125 filing, $139 annual → File at dos.myflorida.com  
- **Kentucky:** $40 filing, $0 annual → File at sos.ky.gov
- **California:** $75 filing, $800+ annual (consider Wyoming LLC for $100)

**Other states:** Google "[your state] LLC filing" - most are $50-$300

**Step 3: Handle the Paperwork**
1. Get your business tax ID (EIN) FREE at irs.gov - **never pay services**
2. Open business bank account (separate from personal)
3. Update insurance policies to business name
4. Start using LLC name on new contracts

**Step 4: S-Corp Election (If Making $75K+ Profit)**
- File Form 2553 with IRS within 75 days of forming LLC
- **FREE to file yourself** - the form is 2 pages
- Or pay your tax guy $200-$500 to handle it
- **Biggest concern:** What's a "reasonable salary"? Rule of thumb: Pay yourself what you'd pay someone else to do your job. Roofer making $95K profit? Pay yourself $50-60K salary, take $35-45K as distributions.

## What About Getting Audited?

**Real talk:** The IRS audits less than 1% of S-Corps annually. Your chances of audit go DOWN with proper structure, not up.

**Red flags that actually trigger audits:**
- Paying yourself $20K salary on $100K profit (too low)  
- Not running payroll at all as S-Corp
- Missing quarterly tax payments

**Green flags (audit protection):**
- Reasonable salary based on industry standards
- Proper payroll records
- Separate business and personal expenses

## The Bottom Line

Wrong business structure costs contractors $5,000-$15,000 annually. Over 10 years? $50,000-$150,000 you'll never get back.

**Most contractors wait until it's too late** - after the lawsuit, after missing out on big commercial jobs, after paying thousands in unnecessary taxes.

Don't be most contractors.
