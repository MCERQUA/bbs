## A Personal Note From Our Founder:

*"I spent years as a roofer, working through pain and pushing my body to the limit until one day, a serious accident on a jobsite changed everything. When I needed my insurance most, I discovered how unprepared I was - both financially and with proper coverage. That experience opened my eyes to a harsh reality: most contractors are one accident away from losing everything.*

*I became an insurance agent to make sure no other contractor would go through what I did. But I realized insurance was just one piece of the puzzle. Contractors need complete business education - from entity structure to financial management to proper risk protection. That's why I created Blue Collar Business School. This course is everything I wish I had known before my accident - the knowledge that would have protected my family and my future."*
