## Sole Proprietorship

### Definition

- Minimal paperwork and compliance
- Direct tax reporting on personal return (Schedule C)

**Cost-Effective:**

- No ongoing filing fees
- No separate tax return required
- Minimal ongoing compliance costs

**Complete Control:**
- 100% decision-making authority
- Keep all profits
- No corporate formalities required
- Easy to dissolve

### Cons for Contractors:

**Unlimited Personal Liability:**
- Personal assets (home, savings, vehicles) at risk
- No protection from business debts or lawsuits
- One accident can wipe out personal wealth
- Worker injury claims affect personal finances

**Tax Disadvantages:**

**Business Limitations:**

### Best For:
- Part-time contractors (under $25,000 annual revenue)
- Very low-risk trades (interior painting, basic handyman)

- Contractors planning to incorporate within 6 months

### Trade-Specific Considerations:

**LOW RISK (may work as sole proprietor):**

## S-Corporation

### Definition
A tax election (not a business type) that can be made by LLCs or C-Corporations to avoid double taxation while gaining employment tax benefits.

### How It Works for Contractors:

4. File separate business tax return (1120S)

### Pros for Contractors:

**Significant Tax Savings:**
- Self-employment tax only on salary portion
- Distributions not subject to 15.3% self-employment tax

**Business Benefits:**
- Same liability protection as LLC
- Professional credibility
- Business loan and credit advantages
- Growth and partnership flexibility

**Employment Benefits:**

**Ongoing Costs:**

### Best For:
- Profitable LLCs earning $75,000+ annual profit
- Contractors wanting to minimize self-employment taxes
- Businesses with consistent monthly cash flow
- Owners comfortable with additional compliance

### S-Corp Tax Calculation Examples:

**Example 1: HVAC Contractor**
- Annual Profit: $120,000
- Reasonable Salary: $60,000
- Distribution: $60,000

*Tax Comparison:*
- **As LLC**: $120,000 × 15.3% = $18,360 self-employment tax
- **As S-Corp**: $60,000 × 15.3% = $9,180 payroll tax
- **Annual Savings**: $9,180

**Example 2: Electrical Contractor**
- Annual Profit: $85,000
- Reasonable Salary: $45,000
- Distribution: $40,000

*Tax Comparison:*
- **As LLC**: $85,000 × 15.3% = $13,005 self-employment tax
- **As S-Corp**: $45,000 × 15.3% = $6,885 payroll tax
- **Annual Savings**: $6,120

### Break-Even Analysis:
- **Additional S-Corp Costs**: $2,000-$4,000 annually
- **Break-even Profit Level**: $60,000-$75,000
- **Optimal Salary Percentage**: 35-50% of business profit

## Conclusion and Recommendations

**For 85% of contractors, LLC is the optimal choice** - providing liability protection, tax flexibility, operational benefits, and growth potential at reasonable cost.

**The 15% exceptions:**
- 10% should use LLC with S-Corp election (high-profit contractors)
- 3% should use C-Corporation (large companies with complex needs)  
- 2% may temporarily use sole proprietor (part-time, low-risk start-ups)

**Key Decision Factors:**
1. **Revenue Level**: Primary determiner of optimal structure
2. **Risk Level**: High-risk trades need LLC minimum
3. **Growth Plans**: Expansion plans favor LLC or corporation
4. **Tax Optimization**: Higher profits benefit from S-Corp election
5. **Complexity Tolerance**: More structure requires more compliance

The cost of choosing the wrong entity structure typically far exceeds the cost of choosing correctly, making this one of the most important business decisions contractors make.
