### Tax Structure Overview
**Election Process**: File Form 2553 within 75 days of formation or by March 15th
**Business Taxes**: File Form 1120S (informational return, no tax owed)
**Personal Taxes**: Profits pass through to owner's personal return
**Payroll Taxes**: Owner must take "reasonable salary" subject to payroll taxes
**Distributions**: Additional profits distributed without self-employment tax

### The S-Corp Tax Advantage Explained
**Key Concept**: Only salary subject to payroll taxes (15.3%), distributions are not

**Reasonable Salary Requirement**:
- Must pay market-rate salary for services performed
- IRS audits S-Corps with unreasonably low salaries
- Penalties for non-compliance can be severe

### S-Corp Tax Calculation Example: Electrical Contractor
**Annual Business Profit**: $100,000
**Reasonable Salary**: $60,000 (market rate for master electrician)
**Distribution**: $40,000

**Payroll Tax Calculation**:
- Salary Subject to Payroll Tax: $60,000
- Employer Portion (company pays): $60,000 × 7.65% = $4,590
- Employee Portion (owner pays): $60,000 × 7.65% = $4,590
- Total Payroll Taxes: $9,180

**Income Tax Calculation**:
- W-2 Wages: $60,000
- Business Distribution: $40,000
- Total Personal Income: $100,000
- Federal Income Tax: ~$12,500 (after standard deduction)

**Total Federal Taxes**: $9,180 + $12,500 = $21,680

**Comparison to LLC Treatment**:
- LLC Self-Employment Tax: $100,000 × 92.35% × 15.3% = $14,130
- S-Corp Payroll Tax: $9,180
- **Annual Savings**: $4,950

### S-Corp Additional Costs
**Payroll Processing**: $1,200-$3,600 annually
**Tax Preparation**: $800-$2,500 annually (1120S)
**Workers Compensation**: Required on owner salary in most states
**Compliance Costs**: Corporate formalities, estimated at $500 annually

**Net S-Corp Benefit**: $4,950 - $3,000 (average additional costs) = $1,950

### Break-Even Analysis for S-Corp Election
**Formula**: (Business Profit × 15.3% × 92.35%) - (Reasonable Salary × 15.3%) = SE Tax Savings

**Break-Even Calculation**:
- Additional annual costs: ~$3,000
- Required savings to break even: $3,000
- Using 40% salary ratio: Profit needed = $3,000 ÷ (15.3% × 92.35% × 60%) = ~$55,000

**Recommended Minimum**: $75,000 annual profit for S-Corp election
