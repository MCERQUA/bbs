- **Tax-Driven** (Sarah's Electric): CPA advice led to proactive S-Corp election - highly successful
- **Growth-Driven** (Johnson HVAC): Multi-state expansion drove reorganization - successful
- **Partnership Issues** (Martinez Plumbing): Liability and management drove LLC conversion - very successful
- **Strategic Growth** (Elite Construction): Investment needs drove C-Corp conversion - successful but complex

**Revenue Level Patterns**:
- **Under $200K**: LLC conversion universally beneficial
- **$200K-$500K**: S-Corp election typically optimal

### Key Decision Factors

1. **Revenue Level**: Primary determiner of optimal structure
2. **Growth Plans**: Future plans more important than current situation
3. **Risk Tolerance**: Both business and personal asset protection needs
4. **Family Situation**: Succession and family involvement considerations
5. **Professional Relationships**: Customer and vendor expectations
