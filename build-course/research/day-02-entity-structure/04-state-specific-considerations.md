## Implementation Recommendations

### For New Contractors:
1. **Start with home state** unless prohibited by high costs
2. **Choose LLC structure** for 90% of situations
3. **Plan for S-Corp election** once profit exceeds $75K
4. **Consider business-friendly states** only if multi-state plans

### For Existing Sole Proprietors:
1. **Convert to LLC immediately** if revenue > $50K or have employees
2. **Use home state** unless annual costs exceed $500
3. **Factor in conversion costs** vs. ongoing savings

### For Growing Companies:
1. **Evaluate multi-state needs** annually
2. **Consider reincorporation** in business-friendly states
3. **Plan for eventual S-Corp or C-Corp conversion**

### Red Flags for State Selection:
- Annual costs exceed 2% of business revenue
- Complex compliance requirements beyond your capability
- Weak legal precedent for your industry
- Hostile business environment or high litigation risk

## Conclusion

State selection for business entity formation should prioritize where you actually conduct business, followed by cost considerations and legal protections. While business-friendly states like Wyoming and Delaware offer advantages, most contractors benefit from forming in their home state unless costs are prohibitive.

The key is balancing formation and ongoing costs with legal protections, operational simplicity, and compliance requirements. For most contractors, an LLC formed in their home state provides the best combination of protection, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
