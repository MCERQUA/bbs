**Content:**
```

✓ Required for commercial jobs

S-Corp Election (if $75K+ profit):
✓ All LLC benefits PLUS
✓ Save $3,500+ annually in taxes

```

## REJECTED VISUAL ELEMENTS

### Decorative Graphics
- **Rejected:** Mike Rodriguez story illustration
- **Why:** Story works well in text format, visual adds no comprehension value

### Complex Infographics  
- **Rejected:** Multi-step process flowcharts
- **Why:** Email format limits complexity, text instructions are clearer for mobile

### State-by-State Filing Costs Map
- **Rejected:** Visual map of filing costs by state
- **Why:** Information is better as searchable text list, map doesn't improve usability

### Audit Statistics Charts
- **Rejected:** Pie charts showing audit rates
- **Why:** Single statistic (less than 1%) is more impactful in text

## ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

**Total Recommended Visuals:** 2 (highly restrictive approach)

**Rationale for Minimalism:**
- Email content flows logically without visual interruption
- Stories and examples work effectively in text format
- Mobile email clients have limited visual rendering capabilities
- Contractors need actionable information, not decorative elements

**Mobile Optimization Notes:**
- Both recommended visuals use only text and basic symbols
- No images, charts, or graphics that could fail to load
- Content remains fully functional if visuals don't render

**Printability:** 
- Both visual elements are text-based and print clearly
- Can be easily copied/pasted into notes or shared with accountants

The email is content-rich and educational - the minimal visual approach maintains readability while adding only essential clarity to complex financial concepts that contractors must understand to make informed decisions.
